<!--I know this website looks terrible I am sorry. The instructions were not descriptive on how 
pretty we needed to make this website look. I recognized how much I love bootsrtap last semester. I did try to avoid
the css techniques I would usually use like bootstrap because the instructions said not to worry about that yet.
Anyways I just wanted to apologize for how the website looks.-->

                I am excited about this class. I think it will be a great opportunity for me to develop new programming skills.
                After my freshman and throughout my sophomore year I had an internship with 1800contacts as a software engineer.
                Most software developers at 1800 were programming in C#.
                I tried to pick up on a lot of C# but wasn’t able to learn a whole lot because I had other assignments.
                I hope to feel more comfortable in the C# language as I take this class.
                I also hope to gain more confidence in my programming and problem-solving abilities.
                Something I am interested in is pursing a development career and I feel this class can help me decide if that is something I want to do.
